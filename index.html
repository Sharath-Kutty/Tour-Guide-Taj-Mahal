            <p class="a" style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj<br> Mahal? </p> 
            <p class="b-1" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Quite honestly, we can’t think of one. <br><br>
            At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than<br> 
            building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br>
            its magnificence up close.<br> <br>
            After all, this is art. Built in Agra, India between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s<br>
            the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj<br> 
            Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from<br> 
            Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br> <br>
            Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond),<br> 
            and so much more…</p>
        </div>

        <div class="div-sec-2">
            <p class="c" style="font-weight: bolder;">Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</p><br>
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br><br>
            Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br>
            men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.<br><br>
                
            To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br>
            Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from 8-day Golden Triangle tours (now with solo-only<br>
            departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India<br>
            and Nepal.<br><br>
                
            If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from<br>
            Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br>
            you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mumbai!</p><br>

            <p class="d" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally<br>
            prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>
        </div>

        <div class="div-sec-3">
            <P class="e" style="font-weight: bold;">What to bring to the Taj Mahal</P><br>
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have<br>
             minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br><br>

            You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br>
            <ul class="list" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">
                <li>Passport</li><br>
                <li>Money</li><br>
                <li>Water</li><br>
                <li>Medicine</li><br>
                <li>Camera</li><br>
                <li>Phone</li><br>
            </ul>
            <P class="e" style="font-weight: bold;">What to wear to the Taj Mahal</P>
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br>
            need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br><br>

            It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear<br>
            sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br><br>
                
            If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br>the worst of the heat.</p>

            <p class="f" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>

        <div class="div-sec-4">
            <img src="Quatations.png" width="30">
            <p class="g">Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are<br> easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are<br> to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of <br>India – shoes with loads of laces are hard!</p><br>

        <div class="div-sec-5">
             <p  class="e" style="font-weight: bold;">Other things you need to know</p>
             <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">No food is allowed inside.<br><br>

                Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br><br>
                
                Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br>
                Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br>
                video cameras) are not allowed.<br><br>
                
                Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br>
                 wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p>

             <p class="e" style="font-weight: bold;">When you’re at the Taj Mahal</p>
             <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br>
                \ possible).</p><br>
                <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" width="700"><br>
             <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an<br>
                 amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to<br>
                 take you there and back cheaply.)<br><br>

                And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br>
                (or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br>
                 some tips on how to do this:</p>   <br>

                <img src="Quatations.png" width="30">
                <p class="g">The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m<br>
                done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to<br>
                make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then <br>
                they will no longer be surprises!<br>
                The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the<br>
                direction of the sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</p><br><br>

                <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br>
                on a clear day.</p><br>

                <p class="h" style="font-weight: bold;">Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</p><br>
                <p  class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>
                 on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p><br>
                 <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" width="700"><br>
                <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>
                 seeking out.<br> <br>
                 Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, Pravin<br>
                 Tamang. (His photography is amazing – check it out!)</p> <br>

                 <ul class="list-2" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">
                    <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li><br>
                    <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br>
                     platform</li><br>
                    <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li><br>
                    <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li><br>
                    <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>
                     Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br>
                     day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p><br>

            <p class="h" style="font-weight: bold;">What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</p><br>
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then<br>
                 explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
            <p class="i" style="font-weight: bold;">What to do in Agra</p>     

            <p  class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is <br>
            also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century<br>
            Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.<br><br>

            Despite being located on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br>
            many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you<br>
            likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.<br><br>
                
            One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by<br>
            (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe <br>
            run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br>
            stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>

        <div class="div-sec-7">
            <p class="e" style="font-weight: bold;">Where to go outside of Agra</p>     
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br>
            Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.<br><br>

            Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>
            and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br>
            it on this 15-day trip from Delhi to Kathmandu (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p><br>

            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" width="700"><br>
            <p class="img-name" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(193, 192, 192);">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p><br>
            <P class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the ‘Pink City’, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br>
            chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br>
            bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br> <br>

            Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br>
            to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy <br>
            nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this 15-day trip all around <br>
            Rajasthan.</P>

            <p  class="k" style="font-weight: bold;">A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</p><br>
            <p class="b" style="color: rgb(91, 90, 90);">As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough<br>
            clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br><br>

            Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>
            surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work –<br>
            applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried <br>
            out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>
            carried out on the historic site.<br>
